//all of the basic types in Swiftâ€”integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays and dictionaries 
//are value types, and are implemented as structures behind the scenes.
//NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary in Foundation are implemented as classes, not structures.
//NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary instances are always assigned and passed around as a reference to
//an existing instance, rather than as a copy.

// All structures and enumerations are value types in Swift.

//A Swift constant or variable that refers to an instance of some reference type is similar to a pointer in C,
//but is not a direct pointer to an address in memory, and does not require you to write an asterisk (*)
//to indicate that you are creating a reference.
//Instead, these references are defined like any other constant or variable in Swift.
